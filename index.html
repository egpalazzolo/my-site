  <h4>About</h4>
  <p>I am a fourth-yaer PhD candide in the History Department at Johns Hopkins University. My interests span across the Atlantic world over the long-nineteenth century, with an emphasis on food and dining. In the early stages of the dissertation process, the project tentatively focuses on food labor, consumption, and science in late-nineteenth century Chicago anchored in tne 1893 Chicago World's Fair.</p>
  <p>In addition to the dissertation, I have dedicated time in graduate school to teaching as well as a burgeoning interest in the digital humanities. You can learn more about my work by following those links.</p>
  
  <h4>I'm very interested in the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Here is an 'Exhibit.' of a map of that event.<h4>
