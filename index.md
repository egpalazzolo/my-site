#### About
I am a fourth-year PhD candide in the History Department at Johns Hopkins University. My interests span across the Atlantic world over the long-nineteenth century, with an emphasis on food and dining. In the early stages of the dissertation process, the project tentatively focuses on food labor, consumption, and science in late-nineteenth century Chicago anchored in tne 1893 Chicago World's Fair

In addition to the dissertation, I have dedicated time in graduate school to developing my capacities as a teacher and also as a student of the digital humanities. You can learn more about my work by following those links.

I'm very interested in the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Here is an 'Exhibit.' of a map of that event.
