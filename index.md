#### About
I am a fourth-year PhD candide in the History Department at Johns Hopkins University. My interests span across the Atlantic world over the long-nineteenth century, with an emphasis on food and dining. In the early stages of the dissertation process, the project tentatively focuses on food labor, consumption, and science in late-nineteenth century Chicago anchored in the 1893 Chicago World's Fair.

In addition to the dissertation, I have dedicated time in graduate school to developing my capacities as a teacher and also as a student of the digital humanities. I've shared my [CV](cv.md) and more on all three of these areas of focus at the following links:
